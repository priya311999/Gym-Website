      <h5 class="w3-center">OUR BELIEF</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">When we created GYM Base,we knew we wanted to be more than just a simple gym.
Having worked in traditional gyms in the past,we knew we needed to create a concept that would provide our members with the most effective tools for success.This meant we needed to offer a wide range of classes both for children and adults.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">We want to share our passion for fitness and create a community based on the pursuit of fitness.Our mission is to keep people active.We are committed to providing excellent customer service,open communication and never losing focus on helping individuals achieve balance and success inside and outside the gym.</p>
